> Anyway, here's a bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project that's probably gonna break the multiverse.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make a real-life portal gun (and also Rust).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that seems schwifty.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about theoretical physics, coding, or where to find the best Szechuan sauce.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Just scream my name into the void, or use these links...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Rick/Sanchez
- âš¡ Fun fact: I believe Birdperson did nothing wrong.
